# Welcome to the Calderon Lab website!
This was built with Jekyll, GitHub Pages and a very handy [template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio). Please reach out if you notice any typos or something isn't working.

## Running locally
Start by making sure Ruby is installed on your computer (for Mac, use `brew install ruby`), as well as Bundler (`gem install bundler`), and [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/index.php) for dynamic image resizing. Next, clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/diego-calderon-lab/diego-calderon-lab.github.io`, change directory into the repo, and serve with `bundle exec jekyll serve`. Building the website can take up to a few minutes.

## Contributing
Having a basic familiarity with Git is a helpful skill to have when working with software. For this reason, we highly encourage lab members (and anyone else) to contribute to this website.

To contribute - typically to include lab member profile information, or a post about a research project - first fork this repo or create a new branch, then make any edits, and finally open a pull request to merge your changes into the main website repo. Someone will review the request and either accept the changes or provide feedback on additional changes to incorporate before a pull request can be accepted.

There are many tutorials available describing this process ([for example](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-a-project)), but Git and GitHub are notoriously intimidating/challenging, so let someone in the lab know, and we can help you get started. Alternatively, feel free to create an issue with your proposed changes.

I am in the process of developing an internal doc with a more thorough tutorial.
