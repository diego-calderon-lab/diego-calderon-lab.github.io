## SRTP student Summer 2025

I am an undergraduate student in the biomedical engineering department at the University of Texas at San Antonio graduating spring of 2027. I am excited to be a part of Dr. Calderon's lab summer 2025 through the Summer Research Training program at UCSF, working on how the genome is affected when treated with different oncogenes under PhD student Madeline Chertkow. Some of my background includes genetics work using Drosophila, and tactics like microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. When I am not in the lab, I love to ride my bike, go to yoga, paint, and spend time with my dog June.
