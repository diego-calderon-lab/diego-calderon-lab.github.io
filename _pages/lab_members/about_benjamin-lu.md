## Summer Student

I'm a high school student at Gunn High School (Class of 2028) with a strong interest in genetics and molecular biology. This summer (2025), I'm thrilled to be joining the Calderon Lab as a student volunteer, where Iâ€™ll be shadowing and learning wet lab techniques under lab manager Kina Atkin-Yamaguchi. I'll be getting hands-on experience with procedures such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), plasmid extraction, E. coli transformation, and more. Previously, I worked on neurodegeneration research using Drosophila, focusing on the tau protein, Reverse Electron Transport in the mitochondrial complex, and their connections to Alzheimer's disease.

Outside the lab, I enjoy playing basketball, walking dogs as a side hustle, and watching Tarantino films. I also play the saxophone, and some of my favorite musical artists are Frank Ocean, Lil Wayne, and Coldplay.
