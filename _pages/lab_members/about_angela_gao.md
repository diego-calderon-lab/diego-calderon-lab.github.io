## Rotation student (Tetrad)

Hi everyone, my name is Angela! I was born and raised in Beijing, China, but I immigrated to Chino Hills, CA when I was 11 years old. After receiving a BS in Mechanical Engineering from UCLA, I spent two years in the Floor Lab at UCSF, where I studied the molecular pathways involved in stress granule formation when human cells are treated with periodic stress. Moving forward, my goal is to incorporate my engineering background into developing new methods that advance the fundamental understanding of the natural world. Outside the lab, I enjoy watching sci-fi movies, going to the beach, playing with my cats and dogs, and exploring local bars.
