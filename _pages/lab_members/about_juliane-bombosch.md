## Rotation student (BioE) Fall 2025

I am a Ph.D. student in the Bioengineering joint program between UC Berkeley and UCSF and rotating student in the Calderon Lab. I received my Bachelor of Arts degree in Neuroscience with Honors from Smith College.

Post graduation, I joined SanBio Inc. to investigate how transplanted mesenchymal stem/stromal cell therapies restore cortical excitability and improve recovery following ischemic stroke in rats. In Dr. Aaron Gitlerâ€™s lab, where I explored why skeletal motor neurons are particularly vulnerable in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), contributing to multiple publications on disease-associated motor neuron states and axonal regeneration defects.

On my free time, I love swimming, dancing salsa and bachata, and learning to cook.
