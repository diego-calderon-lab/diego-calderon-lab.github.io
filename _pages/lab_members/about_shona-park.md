## Laboratory Assistant

I am a Laboratory Technician in the Calderon Lab and a sophomore undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, majoring in Molecular and Cellular Biology. In my role, I support ongoing research by assisting with day-to-day laboratory operations, including preparing reagents, maintaining lab organization, and carrying out experimental tasks essential to data collection and analysis. Through this position, I hope to strengthen my technical skills, deepen my understanding of experimental design, and gain hands-on exposure to the research process in a collaborative scientific environment.

In my free time, I enjoy reading, traveling, exploring new coffee shops, and taking Pilates classes.
