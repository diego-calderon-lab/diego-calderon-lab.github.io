# Join our team!
 
The lab is looking to recruit talented inviduals interested in joining our science community. If the following roles don't apply to you, and you're still interested in joining, feel free to reach out and we'll figure something out.

**Graduate students**. Applicants should be accepted through one of UCSF's graduate programs. Still, I encourage you to reach out before submitting an application because I can I advise you on what might be the most relevant program. Potential rotation students should contact Diego to discuss. A typical ~10 week rotation, will include:
- A rotation project that we collaboratively choose to blend your interests with the interests of the lab, along with mentor availability.
- An initial short lab meeting (5 min) to introduce yourself and your rotation project.
- Scheduled weekly meetings with Diego to update him on your research and career.
- A final lab meeting presentation.

<!-- **Research Scientists**. Reach out to Diego with a bit about yourself and your science interests, along with a CV or resume. Promising research scientist candidates will be expected to provide contact information for references. It takes time to get oriented, learn, and produce high-quality data in the lab (wet lab or dry lab!). For this reason, I expect at least a 2-year commitment. If this doesn't work for you, still contact me and maybe we can figure something out. In the lab, you can expect to receive mentorship tailored to your career goals and work closely with graduate students or postdocs in the lab. Typically the duties of the position will include a combination of project-based work and general lab maintenance (depending on need). -->

**Postdocs**. Reach out to Diego with a bit about yourself and your science interests, along with a CV or resume. Promising postdoc candidates will be expected to provide contact information for references. We are happy to submit any paperwork on behalf of the lab for any postdoctoral fellowships.

**Environment**. Our lab aims to be composed of a unique mix of smart, interactive people from a wide range of personal backgrounds and scientific backgrounds, including genetics/genomics, biology, and quantitative fields like CS/math/stats. My goal is that everyone should have the resources and support that they need to be successful.
