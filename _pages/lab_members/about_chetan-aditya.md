## Postdoc

I am an interdisciplinary researcher trained in bioinformatics, data analysis and synthetic biology with extensive experience in genetic engineering, bioproduction, immunology and cancer.
I am fascinated by biological transitions and want to understand how these changes come about from a mechanistic standpoint. In this pursuit, I have developed optogenetic controllers that dictate cell fate, biosensors that report on dynamics of signaling activity and most recently, in the Calderon lab, I am invested in developing methodologies that will allow us to monitor transcriptomic changes during biological transitions.

My leisures include reading contemporary fiction, writing poetry and devouring cinema.
