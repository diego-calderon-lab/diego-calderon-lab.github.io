# Diego Calderon
## Principal Investigator

<!-- Diego's academic journey started at Wesleyan University, where, after a brief (and failed foray) into film studies, he eventually received a B.A. in Computer Science and Biology. An inspiring summer annotating the newly sequenced King Cobra genome in the Yandell Lab at the University of Utah motivated him to pursue a Ph.D. He carried out his dissertation research on the genetics underlying complex traits supervised by Dr. Jonathan Pritchard at Stanford University.

Intrigued by the world of massively parallel molecular biology, he then joined the labs of Drs. Jay Shendure and Cole Trapnell at the University of Washington. There, he led projects relying on the computational analysis of single-cell data and developed new massively parallel reporter assays to investigate gene regulation. These projects were graciously supported by a T32, F32, and a BWF-CASI transition award.

In 2024, Diego joined UCSF as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences and established The Calderon Lab. Our Lab broadly aims to understand all aspects of how DNA is translated into life using cutting-edge computational and experimental techniques. Recently, weâ€™ve been excited to apply deep learning and other machine learning techniques to interpret results from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), single-cell assays, and CRISPR screens. Our projects typically focus on using these techniques to study how DNA mutations can lead to disease or characterize cellular control of gene expression, but our interests encompass many topics generally related to DNA. We are affiliated with the Quantitative Biosciences Institute, the Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Institute for Human Genetics, and the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub. Our efforts continue to be generously funded by a BWF-CASI. -->

Diego received his B.A. from Wesleyan University and subsequently conducted his Ph.D. research on the genetics underlying complex traits at Stanford University. Intrigued by massively parallel molecular biology, he then went on to become a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington, where he led projects involving the computational analysis of large-scale single-cell data and developed new massively parallel reporter assays to investigate gene regulation. In 2024, Diego joined UCSF as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences.

Outside of lab, Diego can be found jogging and engrossed in his latest audiobook, while liberally sending kudos on the lab's Strava account. Currently, he is halfway through 'Words of Radiance', part of Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive series.
