# Diego Calderon
## Principal Investigator

Diego received his B.A. from Wesleyan University and subsequently conducted his Ph.D. research on the genetics underlying complex traits at Stanford University. Intrigued by massively parallel molecular biology, he then went on to become a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Washington, where he led projects involving the computational analysis of large-scale single-cell data and developed new massively parallel reporter assays to investigate gene regulation. In 2024, Diego joined UCSF as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences.

Outside of lab, Diego can be found jogging and engrossed in his latest audiobook, while liberally sending kudos on Strava. Currently, he just started listening to 'Oathbringer', part of Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archive series. He's also nearly done reading 'At the Helm', and has finally started the first few pages of 'The Eight Day of Creation'.
