# Kina Atkin-Yamaguchi
## Lab Manager

I am the Lab Manager at the Calderon Lab and a Junior Specialist in the PROPEL Program at UCSF. My responsibilities in the lab include general lab operations and research. I obtained my General Biology (B.S.) Degree from the University of Washington in 2024 and worked as a Laboratory Technician at the Shendure Lab in the Department of Genome Sciences during my time there. I conducted plant genetics research at Hokkaido University in the Miwa Lab as a Special Auditor in the Department of Biology. My goal is to attend graduate school to obtain a PhD in a field related to genetics and genomics.

In my free time, I love to run, hike, read at coffee shops, bake, and spend time with my friends and family. My favorite place to visit is Japan!
