# Madeline Chertkow
## PhD student (BioE)

I am a Ph.D. student in the Bioengineering joint program between UC Berkeley and UCSF. My research interests include understanding how oncogenic progression impacts cell state. I am building a tool that we can use to investigating whether the consequences that stem from titrated oncogeneic events can be encoded within a cell's "memory". I received my Bachelor of Science degree in Biomolecular Engineering and Bioinformatics from UCSC. I am a 2023 UCSF SRTP alumni. Outside of lab, I enjoy trying new food, expanding my wine palette, reading, cooking, and exploring the city.
