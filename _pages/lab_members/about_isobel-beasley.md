## Rotation student (BMI) Spring 2025

I am a Biological and Medical Informatics PhD student at UCSF. Broadly speaking, I’m interested in advancing equitable genetics research with interdisciplinary approaches. My current rotation project is a collaboration between the Calderon and Andrews labs, aiming to better understand the cell types and traits important in Alzheimer’s development.

Outside the lab, I maintain a science blog sharing code snippets, teaching resources, and research reflections. In my free time, I love photographing and drawing wildlife.
