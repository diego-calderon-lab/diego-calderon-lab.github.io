## Instructors

* [Nadav Ahituv](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/nadav.ahituv)

## Overview

What can genetics teach us about human biology, disease, and discovering new drugs? In this mini-immersion, students will explore how large-scale human genetic data are generated and analyzed, and how these insights can inform mechanisms of disease and guide drug discovery.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. **Explain** key concepts, techniques, and landmark discoveries in modern human genetics.

2. **Analyze** large-scale genomic datasets and public resources to assess the relevance of genetic variation to human disease.

3. **Formulate** hypotheses about how specific DNA mutations may influence human phenotypes and identify potential therapeutic targets.
