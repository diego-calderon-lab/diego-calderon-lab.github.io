<span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">**Our research**</span></span> aims to understand how DNA is translated into life. To study this transformation, we use cutting-edge computational and experimental techniques. Recently, we've been excited to apply deep learning and other machine learning methods to interpret results from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), single-cell assays, and CRISPR screens. Our projects typically focus on using these technologies to study how DNA mutations can lead to disease or characterize cellular control of gene expression, but they also encompass many topics generally related to DNA. Head over to the [research page](/research) to read more!
