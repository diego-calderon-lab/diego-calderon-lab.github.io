<span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">**Our research**</span></span> aims to understand how DNA is translated into life. To study this transformation, we use cutting-edge computational and experimental techniques. Recently, we've been excited to apply deep learning and other machine learning methods to interpret results from massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs), single-cell assays, and CRISPR screens. Our projects typically focus on using these technologies to study how DNA mutations can lead to disease or characterize cellular control of gene expression, but they also encompass many topics generally related to DNA. Head over to the [research page](/research) to read more!

<span style="font-size:larger;">**We are**</span> a part of the [Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences](https://bts.ucsf.edu) at the University of California, San Francisco.
<!-- TBD: the [Quantitative Biosciences Institute](https://qbi.ucsf.edu) -->
We are also affiliated with the [Institute for Human Genetics](https://humangenetics.ucsf.edu/content/diego-calderon-phd), the [Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://cancer.ucsf.edu/people/calderon.diego), and the [Biohub – San Francisco](https://www.czbiohub.org/sf/).
Visit us in Rock Hall at the Mission Bay Campus of UCSF.

<span style="font-size:larger;"><span style="font-size:larger;">**Join us!**</span></span> The lab is looking to recruit talented individuals interested in joining our science community. Information on applying can be found at the bottom of the [people page](/people#join-our-team) or contact Diego if you have more questions.
