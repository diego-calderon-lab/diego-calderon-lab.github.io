# Inquiry Immersion - Human Genetics

The genomic revolution has transformed our ability to understand human biology, disease, and evolution. In 2001, sequencing a human genome cost nearly $3 billion and took years to complete. Today, that same task can be done in hours for under $1,000, and the cost continues to decline. This technological revolution has enabled the sequencing of hundreds of thousands of individuals, creating unprecedented opportunities to study human genetic variation at scale. In this mini-course, students will explore how large-scale human genetic data are generated and analyzed using modern computational tools and databases. We will examine how these insights reveal the genetic basis of human traits and diseases, inform drug discovery efforts, and raise important ethical considerations about the use of genetic information in medicine and society.
