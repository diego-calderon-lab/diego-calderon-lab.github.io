To celebrate the end of a jam-packed 2024, we went for a relaxing hike and a big lunch. Details for the trail are [here](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/california/nimitz-way-easy-route), which took us through the east bay rolling hills. It was a fantastic route for walking and talking.

Unfortunately, I forgot to snap a photo of the team at lunch at [Gangnam Tofu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/AMq8Guj48SR7USuW7). I likely forgot because I was so distracted by how delicious all the food looked as it came out. As might be expected, I've already saved the restaurant for a follow-up visit.

For lab news, Wan-Yu has accepted a new role in the Dean's office of the School of Pharmacy, so she'll be leaving us. We all wish her the best! Congrats Wan-Yu!
