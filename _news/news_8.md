It has been a very busy quarter since our last update at the end of the summer, and we have lots to celebrate.

NSF GRFP applications were submitted in mid October. Best of luck to everyone who applied. We are proud of all the work that went into preparing those proposals.

It was also graduate program retreat season, and we were pleased to see Rashad and Kina present excellent posters. In addition, Kina presented her poster at ABRCMS in San Antonio after winning a travel scholarship, which was a great accomplishment and well deserved.

Several rotations have recently come to a close. We greatly enjoyed having Noah, Juliane, and Carlos in the lab and appreciate all their contributions. We wish them the very best in their upcoming rotations and next steps.

To cap things off, we celebrated with a lab dinner and happy hour. It was a great chance to relax after a busy few weeks and spend time together outside the lab.

As the year wraps up, we wish everyone a happy holiday season and a wonderful New Year. We are looking forward to everything the coming year will bring.
