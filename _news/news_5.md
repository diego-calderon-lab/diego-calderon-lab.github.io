Yesterday, we were all eager to take a break from the lab, test our knowledge of random facts, and, most importantly, welcome Chetan and Madeline to the team! We started off with a mandatory lab selfie in front of the UCSF medical center sign, and then headed to Ballast Point Brewery for dinner and trivia.

Everyone contributed facts from a wide range of topics — geography, guitar chords, the ages of the Kardashian sisters, and more — and at one point, we even found ourselves tied for second place! However, while we proudly represented both our department and a certain famous Korean boy band, our trivia skills didn’t quite carry us to victory in the later rounds.

Still, it was a fantastic evening, and I’m already looking forward to our next lab outing!
