Time flies when you're doing amazing science. We just celebrated one year of the lab! Huge thanks to everyone who helped make it such a great year, especially our incredible lab members. We marked the occasion with a "State of the Lab" presentation (we’re strong and thriving despite a rapidly changing science landscape) followed by a fun BBQ celebration, where we finally had a chance to take an updated lab photo.

We also said goodbye to our wonderful summer students, Benjamin Lu and Lia Sorrell. Lia wrapped up with an impressive talk and poster at the SRTP symposium. We’re expecting big things from both of them.

And finally, a warm welcome to Rashad, who is joining us from the BMI program for a summer rotation. We’re excited to have you with us!
